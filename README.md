# Introduction to Computer Science

_Algoma University   |   Sept 2021_

Understand the structure and components of the Java programming language. Utilize common software components and IDEâ€™s to create, compile, run and test java programs. Use the operating system of the computer to manage files and programs during the development process. Analyze complex problems involving multiple data types, including objects, Strings, and arrays, multiple types of control structures, and describe a solution to the problem in pseudo code. Write, compile, run and test complex problems using the Java programming language. Understand the context of the programming process within the Field of Computer Science
