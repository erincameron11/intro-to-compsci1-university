/*
 * (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy 
 * needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. 
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms 
 * and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute 
 * the energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures 
 * are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
